# Feature Specification: CMS Management Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-cms-n-n`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a comprehensive admin dashboard for the Maliang Blockchain CMS with real user data visualizations."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## üìù Quick Guidelines
- üéØ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- üö´ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an admin user who has successfully logged in, I want to see a comprehensive dashboard showing real user data visualizations so I can monitor system activity and make informed decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they try to access `/maliang-admin/dashboard`, **Then** they are redirected to the login page
2. **Given** an authenticated admin user, **When** they log in successfully, **Then** they are redirected to the dashboard page with real user data visualizations
3. **Given** an authenticated admin user on the dashboard, **When** they view the data visualizations, **Then** the data is pulled from actual database records (not placeholder data)
4. **Given** an authenticated admin user on the dashboard, **When** they click the logout button, **Then** they are logged out and redirected to the login page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there is no user data to display in the visualizations?
- How does the system handle errors when fetching user data?
- What happens when a non-admin user tries to access the dashboard?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST require authentication before accessing any admin dashboard pages
- **FR-002**: Dashboard MUST display real-time or near-real-time user activity data from the actual database
- **FR-003**: System MUST present all interface elements in Chinese language
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement a dark theme with a consistent visual style across all dashboard components
- **FR-005**: Dashboard MUST include a sidebar with at least one menu item ("Áî®Êà∑ÁÆ°ÁêÜ") for navigation
- **FR-006**: Top navigation bar MUST display the current user's name and provide a logout functionality
- **FR-007**: Data visualizations MUST include at least two types of charts (e.g., bar chart and line chart)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide animated transitions between dashboard elements for enhanced user experience
- **FR-009**: Data visualizations MUST update automatically when new user data becomes available with a refresh interval of 60 seconds
- **FR-010**: System MUST gracefully handle cases where user data is unavailable or empty by displaying a friendly message "ÊöÇÊó†Êï∞ÊçÆ" with an icon and refresh button

### Key Entities
- **AdminUser**: Represents an authenticated administrator with access to the dashboard (already exists in admin_users table)
- **UserActivity**: Represents user engagement and system usage metrics that will be visualized on the dashboard including: daily/weekly/monthly active users, content creation counts, user login frequency, and system error logs
