# Feature Specification: Comprehensive CMS Backend System

**Feature Branch**: `003-comprehensive-cms-backend`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Comprehensive CMS Backend System with Content Management, Multi-language Support, SEO Optimization, and User Interaction Features"

## Technical Implementation Guidelines *(added after clarification)*

### Multi-language Translation Management
**Management Interface Default**: Chinese | **Frontend Display Default**: English

**Translation Interface Design**:
- Implement unified translation interface in admin panel using tabs or side-by-side views
- Edit content (articles, products) in same interface with language-specific input fields
- Maintain consistent content structure across all language versions
- Avoid duplicate data entries for each language

**Content Fallback Mechanism**:
- **REQUIRED**: Automatic fallback to default language (Chinese) when requested language content unavailable
- Display clear message: "This page is not yet available in [Language]"
- Prevent 404 errors and maintain professional user experience

**Translation Quality Control**:
- Implement workflow: Draft → Pending Review → Published
- Translators set content to "Pending Review" after completion
- Designated reviewers (native speakers) approve before frontend publication
- Ensure professional content quality across all languages

### Dark Sci-Fi Visual Style Specifications

**Color Palette**:
- **Background**: Pure black (hsl(0 0% 0%)) for deep, professional tech aesthetic
- **Foreground/Text**: Near-white light gray (hsl(0 0% 98%)) for high contrast readability
- **Card/Container**: Pure black with gradient borders using card-gradient-border and gradient-border styles
- **Accent/Primary**: High-brightness white (hsl(210 40% 98%)) for interactive elements
- **Gradients**: Gradient borders from semi-transparent white to transparent for glowing effect

**Typography**:
- **Font Family**: Inter (defined globally in app/layout.tsx) - modern sans-serif optimized for digital screens
- **Size & Weight Hierarchy**:
  - Headings (h1): text-6xl, md:text-7xl, font-bold
  - Body text: text-lg for balanced readability
  - Clear visual hierarchy for improved UX

**Component Styling Patterns**:
- **Borders**: gradient-border and card-gradient-border using ::before pseudo-elements with linear gradients (rgba(255,255,255,0.2) to transparent)
- **Shadows**: Minimal traditional box-shadow; use Spotlight component (components/ui/spotlight.tsx) with radial-gradient and blur filters for glow effects
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle color/background/border changes (e.g., hover:bg-primary/90) with rapid, refined response defined in tailwind.config.js

### Supabase Database Structure & MCP Operations

**Database Table Structure**:
- **RECOMMENDED**: Unified structure using JSONB fields for multi-language content
- Store translations in main tables (products, articles) using JSONB: `"name": {"en": "My Product", "zh": "我的产品"}`
- Avoid separate tables per language (products_en, products_zh) for better scalability and maintainability
- Most efficient approach for CMS scenarios

**MCP-Required Database Operations**:
- **Authentication**: Admin login/logout and session management using existing signInAdmin and getCurrentAdmin functions
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete create, read, update, delete operations for all content models (articles, products, messages, etc.)
- **User Management**: Query, create, update admin accounts from admin_users table
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage integration for media file upload and management

**Performance & Security Requirements**:
- **Security**: Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
  - Public read access for published content
  - Restrict all write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to authenticated admin users with specific roles
- **Performance**: 
  - Create indexes on frequently queried columns (email, role, is_active)
  - Use Supabase Edge Functions for caching high-traffic data
  - Reduce database load and improve response times

### Responsive Design Breakpoints

**Breakpoint Strategy**:
- **Mobile**: < 768px (single-column layout, hamburger navigation menu)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (md breakpoint, multi-column layout begins)
- **Desktop**: > 1024px (lg breakpoint, full desktop layout with horizontal navigation)
- **Large Screen**: 1400px+ (2xl breakpoint defined in tailwind.config.js for large screen optimization)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Uses Tailwind CSS default breakpoints consistently across project
- Components adapt using responsive utilities (lg:hidden, md:block, etc.)
- Already includes 1400px+ large screen considerations

### Animation & Transition Standards

**Preferred Animation Library**:
- **Primary**: Framer Motion as core animation library
- **Component**: AnimatedGroup (components/ui/animated-group.tsx) provides preset animations (fade, slide, blur-slide) with staggerChildren for staggered entrance effects

**Animation Duration Guidelines**:
- **Fast (100ms - 200ms)**: CSS transitions (transition-all duration-200) for immediate interactive feedback (button hovers)
- **Normal (300ms - 600ms)**: Page element entrance animations
  - app/globals.css fadeSlideIn: 0.6s duration
  - AnimatedGroup default stagger delay: 0.1s for rhythmic sequential animations
- **Slow (800ms+)**: Large elements or atmospheric animations (DottedSurface background animations)

**Transition Types**:
- **Entrance Animations**: Upward slide + fade-in combination (Slide Up + Fade In)
  - Implemented via fadeInUp and fadeSlideIn keyframes in app/globals.css
  - AnimatedGroup blur-slide preset
- **Page Transitions**: Architecture supports AnimatePresence-based fade or slide transitions between pages
- **Interactive Feedback**: Subtle color/transform changes using transition-colors and scale transforms for hover/click states

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content administrator, I want to manage all aspects of the company website content through a comprehensive backend system so that I can efficiently create, organize, and optimize content for better user engagement and search engine visibility, while supporting multiple languages and maintaining a seamless user experience across different devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged into the CMS admin panel, **When** I create a new product category, **Then** it should automatically appear in the website's main navigation menu and filtering options.
2. **Given** I have created a product with detailed information including pricing and specifications, **When** I publish it, **Then** it should appear on the corresponding category page with all details visible to website visitors.
3. **Given** I need to update company information, **When** I edit the "About Us" single page content, **Then** the changes should be immediately reflected on the public website without requiring a full refresh.
4. **Given** I want to recruit new talent, **When** I publish a job posting with application form, **Then** interested candidates should be able to submit their resumes through the website, and I should receive their information in the admin message center.
5. **Given** I want to improve content discoverability, **When** I add relevant tags to articles and products, **Then** users should be able to click on these tags to find all related content, and the tags should contribute to better search engine optimization.
6. **Given** I need to enhance the website's visual appeal, **When** I upload and configure banner images for both desktop and mobile views, **Then** the appropriate banners should display correctly on each device type.
7. **Given** a visitor submits a contact form or leaves a message, **When** the form is submitted, **Then** I should receive the message in the admin panel with all provided details for follow-up communication.
8. **Given** I want to improve search engine rankings, **When** I configure friendly links and internal linking structure, **Then** the website should have a logical link structure that helps both users and search engine crawlers navigate the content effectively.
9. **Given** I need to expand the website's global reach, **When** I enable multi-language support and set up automatic language detection based on visitor IP, **Then** visitors should see content in their appropriate language, and I should be able to manually override language selection when needed. **Additionally, when content is not available in the requested language, the system should automatically fall back to Chinese (default language) with a clear user message.**

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a category has no content items? **System should display appropriate empty state messaging while maintaining navigation structure.**
- How does the system handle visitors from countries not covered by the supported languages? **Default to English frontend display with option to manually select from supported languages.**
- What occurs when the sitemap generation encounters content with special characters or very long URLs? **Implement proper URL encoding and truncation with ellipsis for display purposes.**
- How should the system behave when a job application form is submitted with missing required fields? **Display clear validation errors and prevent submission until all required fields are completed.**
- What happens if the automatic IP-based language detection fails or returns an ambiguous result? **Fall back to English as secondary default with manual language selection prominently available.**
