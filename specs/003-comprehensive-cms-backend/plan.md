## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.2.0
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14.2.0, React 18.2.0, Supabase 2.57.4, Framer Motion 10.16.0
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with JSONB fields for multi-language content
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Supabase Test Helpers
**Target Platform**: Web (responsive desktop, tablet, mobile)
**Project Type**: Web application with admin panel and public frontend
**Performance Goals**: <200ms page load times, <100ms API responses, 60fps animations
**Constraints**: No page refreshes, responsive design, dark sci-fi aesthetic compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-language CMS supporting 6 languages, 50+ content types, real-time updates

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **User Experience First**: Responsive design with smooth animations, no-refresh interactions implemented via Next.js App Router and Framer Motion
✅ **Dark Sci-Fi Aesthetic**: Pure black backgrounds, gradient borders, Inter typography, Spotlight components for glow effects
✅ **Content Management Excellence**: Comprehensive CRUD operations for products, articles, static pages with categorization and tagging
✅ **Performance Optimization**: Supabase Edge Functions for caching, optimized queries, responsive breakpoints
✅ **Technological Consistency**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Supabase stack maintained throughout

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure chosen for admin panel + public frontend architecture. Integrates with existing project structure while adding CMS-specific directories for content management, translations, and admin functionality.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Multi-language content storage patterns in Supabase JSONB
   - IP-based language detection accuracy and fallbacks
   - Supabase MCP integration for remote database operations

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research multi-language content storage in Supabase JSONB for CMS"
     Task: "Research IP geolocation services for language detection"
     Task: "Research Supabase MCP integration patterns for remote operations"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for Next.js multi-language routing"
     Task: "Find best practices for Supabase RLS with multi-tenant CMS"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Use JSONB for multi-language content storage
   - Rationale: Efficient querying, schema flexibility, reduced table complexity
   - Alternatives considered: Separate language tables (rejected due to maintenance overhead)

**Output**: research.md with all unknowns resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Content Category, Product, Article, Static Page, Job Posting, Content Tag, Banner/Slideshow, Visitor Message
   - Multi-language JSONB fields for all translatable content
   - Translation workflow states (Draft, Pending Review, Published)

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Content management endpoints (CRUD for all entities)
   - Multi-language content endpoints
   - SEO and configuration endpoints
   - Authentication and admin management endpoints

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint with schema validation
   - Integration tests for multi-language workflows
   - Authentication and authorization tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Content creation and publishing workflows
   - Multi-language content management
   - SEO optimization processes

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType windsurf`
   - Add CMS-specific patterns and multi-language support

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, updated CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Types → Models → Services → Components → Pages
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 40-50 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations identified. All requirements align with established principles for user experience, dark sci-fi aesthetic, content management excellence, performance optimization, and technological consistency.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
